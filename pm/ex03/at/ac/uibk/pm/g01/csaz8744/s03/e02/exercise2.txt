The Thermometer has way to many specific functions
therefore there is almost no encapsulation. 

The Thermometer class is also to powerful und messy therefore should not include every
kind of getter and setter and espacially should not keep all of them Public. Would they 
be kept inside the respectife child classes, the code would be much cleaner and easier and
more intuitive to use.
