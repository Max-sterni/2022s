1. Compiled and works perfectly because the integer is automatically used in the type.
2. Compiles but list is of type object. It will not be practical because the type has to be casted.
3. Compiles but the abstraction is not given. Therefore you will not be able to change implementation easily
4. Does not compile, there is no extends specification.
