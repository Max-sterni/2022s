Public: A variable or method with the Public keyword can be accessed (read/write)
from any refernce to an instance of the object with object.name
Privat: A private variable or method can only be accessed from inside the object. However it can be
returned or set through getter and setter methods. This makes working with these variables safer for other programmers

This returns a reference to the current object
